          <h1>Howdy Tesla,</h1>
          <p>I'm interested in <strong>minimalism</strong>. Cutting down hardware to give way to the iterative software process and <strong>disrupting the status quo</strong>. That's why I want to work at Tesla. Iterative firmware, a rolling, moving <strong>software update</strong>. The more physical buttons we add to an interface, the more we give way to static hardware, the more we move away from sustainability, minimalism, and good design and experience in general. Hardware is essential, but it must be used minimally to provide the most flexible experience. I want to work at a company that understands the importance of having <strong>iterative design</strong>, without having to buy a whole new car.</p>

          <p>I want to live in an age where my car is a long term investment, <strong>sustainable</strong> and upgradeable. I want to be a part of it, I want that to happen faster. This is an approach I know Tesla Motors understands, and that I understand and wish to experience. This is going to be an <strong>automotive revolution</strong>. And I want in.</p>
