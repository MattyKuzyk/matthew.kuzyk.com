          <h1>Howdy Kanjoya,</h1>

          <p>I'm interested in <strong>language</strong>. <strong>Emotionally rich</strong> content is important, we currently don't have the tools to fully understand speech. This becomes increasingly important in an age of voice-recognition, targeted advertising, and shared online experiences.</p>

          <p>That is why I worked at Nuance Communications, and it is why I want to work at Kanjoya. At Nuance, I built systems that could communicate with humans. This was fascinating to me, as a Systems Design Engineer, the most interesting system to me is the interaction between the human the the computer. I want to continue this, I want to further the understanding of <strong>natural language</strong> in humans through the use of <strong>Big Data</strong> and <strong>statistical methods</strong> and use it to help and shape the world around us. It won't be easy, since natural language processing is such a complex craft that relies on so many different fields, ranging from linguistics, to psychology, to good ol' fashion coding.  There's a lot of work to be done, and that's why I want in. I want to be part of the next stage of development in human understanding</p>
