          <h1>Howdy Apple,</h1>
          <p>Hands free connectivity is the future. If we hope to achieve the best experience and ease of use for the user, we must look to the simplicity of natural language interaction. <strong>Simplicity isn’t simple</strong>, however, and getting to that point won’t be easy. I want that future to get here faster, that's why I want to work on Siri, at Apple, and in fact, it’s why I worked at Nuance Communications developing intelligent conversational systems. A core focus of systems design engineering is <strong>human-computer interaction</strong>, and a perspective on the user is key to the evolution of technology. This user first approach is something that is fundamental to my idea of engineering, I know Apple feels the same way, and I want in.</p>
