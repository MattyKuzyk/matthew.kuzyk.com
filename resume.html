          <h1>Howdy Nest,</h1>

          <p>I'm interested in <strong>minimalism</strong>. Cutting down hardware to give way to the iterative software process and eventually create the <strong>smart home</strong>. That's why I want to work at Nest. I want a home built on iterative firmware, a new home with new features every two weeks through <strong>software updates</strong>. The more physical pieces we add, the more we give way to static hardware, the more we move away from sustainability, minimalism, and good design and experience in general. Hardware is essential, but it must be used minimally to provide the most flexible experience. I want to work at a company that understands the importance of having <strong>iterative design</strong>, without having to buy a whole new house. If we wish to achieve a smart home, we have to look to software. I want to be able to say "Okay, Google" to my phone and control my entire home using my voice, that simply. This cannot happen if companies want to keep introducing hardware into the home that will be obsolete in a few years.</p>

          <p>I want to live in an age where my home and the parts in it are a long term investment, <strong>sustainable</strong> and upgradeable. I want to be a part of it, I want that to happen faster. This is an approach I know Nest understands, and that I understand and wish to experience. This is going to be an <strong>home revolution</strong>. And I want in.</p>

          <p>Nest understands this, and that's why I want to work there, because Nest is one of few companies that is pushing the boundaries of what we do in the home in a smart way. I understand this, and my values align with that </p>
